# Library for the MLX90614 sensor

This library allows us to handle the sensor I2C MLX9014. This sensor allows us to measure two variables, on the one hand, we have the object temperature, and on the other hand the room temperature. To do the program was used the MCU MSP430FR4133, with which it communicates through the i2c protocol.
